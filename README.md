Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to predict medical insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The dataset contains real-world health and cost records and is ideal for practicing regression concepts and model diagnostics.

ðŸ”§ Problem Statement

Insurance companies calculate premiums based on risk. People who smoke, are older, or have higher BMI pay more.
Goal: Predict the medical insurance charges based on personal profile data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

age	Age of the person	Numerical
sex	Male / Female	Categorical
bmi	Body Mass Index (weight/heightÂ²)	Numerical
children	Number of dependents	Numerical
smoker	Yes / No	Categorical
region	Residential area in US	Categorical
charges	Medical insurance cost	Target

ðŸ”Ž Key Insights

smoker is the strongest predictor of insurance cost.

age and bmi also show a strong positive relationship with charges.

The original charges column was positively skewed, so we applied log transformation to improve prediction.

The model works well as a baseline, but residuals show heteroscedasticity, meaning non-linear models may perform better.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Metric	Value (approx)
MAE	~2600
RMSE	~4500
RÂ²	~0.79

âœ… Model explains 79% of the variance, but can be improved using feature interactions or non-linear models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Add interaction terms (e.g., age * smoker)

Train advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Hyperparameter tuning

Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
